## Data Science Job Salary Prediction

Data of data science job posts from the website glassdoor are collected. This project aims to predict whether the salary is high or not. First, I created a categorical variable high_salary based on the avg_salary: if avg_salary ≥ 150 , high_salary = 1; if avg_salary < 150, high_salary = 0. This new variable high_salary will be the prediction outcome.

## Project Duration

This project took around two weeks. I started it by getting an understanding of the data and cleaning it. After that, I started my analysis with data visualization. After understanding the data's characteristics, I made predictions using several classification methods.
